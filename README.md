## ✅ Work Done

### 📂 1. Setting Up CookieCutter
- Installed CookieCutter using pip.
- Used CookieCutter to create a new project structure from the `cookiecutter-data-science` template.
- Navigated into the created project directory and explored its structure.

### 🔗 2. Setting Up Git Repository
- Initialized a Git repository in the project folder.
- Committed the initial files and project structure.

### 📊 3. Setting Up DVC
- Installed DVC using pip.
- Initialized DVC in the project directory.
- Added a sample dataset (`data/sample_data.csv`) and tracked it using DVC.
- Committed DVC changes to Git.

### 🌍 4. GitHub Repository
- Created a GitHub repository for the project.
- Pushed the project structure and tracked dataset to GitHub.
